## About me
My name is Jerry Gambrell, and I am currently a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University in the Master's of Science in Artificial Intelligence program. I recently graduated from FAU with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (December '24), and also hold degrees and certification in Psychology and humn behavior. Although my primary area of interest lies in robotics and embedded systems designs, I have completed undergraduate and graduate coursework areas such as Circuit Analysis, Control Systems, Electronics, Sensor Networking and Smart Systems, Logic Design, and Tissue Engineering. I also took a "project-based" approach to my education, volunteering for research projects whenever possible; while also exploring several interesting personal projects related to embedded systems and robotics in my free time. As a result, I also have experience in circuit board design, smd soldering, 3-D printing, and general protoyping of electronic devices. My long-term goal involves eventually combining my experience with technology and human behavior to develop products that will enhance the lives of everyday people.

## About this repository
This repository is a compilation of embedded systems, robotics, and machine learning projects that have been completed over the past four years for engineering/computer science coursework, or as personal pursuits. It is meant to provide some insight into the various projects which I have undertaken, and the skills and techniques that were used in order to complete them. Projects will be divided into two categories: Those that are university-related (as part of academic coursework or volunteer project), and those completed as personal projects or as an independent contractor.
