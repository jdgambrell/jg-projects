## About me
My name is Jerry Gambrell, and I am currently a graduate student at Florida Atlantic University in the Master's of Science in Artificial Intelligence program. I recently graduated from FAU with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (December '24), and also hold degrees and certification in Psychology and humn behavior. Although my primary area of interest lies in robotics and embedded systems designs, I have completed undergraduate and graduate coursework areas such as Circuit Analysis, Control Systems, Electronics, Logic Design and ____________. I also took a "project-based" approach to my education, volunteering for research projects whenever possible, while also exploring several interesting personal projects related to embedded systems and robotics in my free time. As a result, I also have experience in circuit board design, smd soldering, 3-D printing, and general protoyping of electronic devices. My long term goal involves eventually combining my experience with technology and human behvaior to develop products that will enhance the lives of everyday people.
